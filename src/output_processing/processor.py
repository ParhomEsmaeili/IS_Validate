    This class OR module needs to be able to process the app output in the following capacities:
    Needs to modify the output data dictionary such that it matches expected structure of the interaction state constructors
    Needs to implement the writers, for writing the pred, and logits, then adding the paths for each of these correspondingly to 
    the corresponding written files in the expected structure of the interaction state constructor.
