        This function takes the information pertaining to the data which is being used for experimentation.
        
        It permits two use cases, validation and hold-out test sets. 

        Assumes a dataset structure of the following manner: 

        datasets
        |___ dataset_name 
                  |______ ?
                  |______dataset.json (For validation and/or hold-out test set)
                  |______splits.json (For validation)

        ? = Whatever dataset structure you like, this must be represented in the corresponding dataset.json and splits.json files however. We recommend a MSD (or nnU-Net) 
        convention. 

        The corresponding results will be placed in 


        Assumes the following information is stored in a dictionary in the dataset.json file:
            
            Key: ext - File extension type (e.g. nii.gz is only currently supported) 
            
            Key: "training" - List of dictionaries for each image-sample in the training/val set, contains two keys: "image" and "label", each with a relative path from dataset_name 
            to the corresponding data (with no ext)

            Key: "test" - List of dictionaries for each image-sample in the hold out test set, contains two keys: "image" and "label", each with a relative path from dataset_name 
            to the corresponding data (with no ext)

            Key: class_labels - Class label configs in a dictionary format: {"class_1": int, "class_2": int, etc.}

        Assumes the following information is stored in the splits.json file (REQUIRED for validation):
            Dictionary for each fold, with keys "fold_i" with i = 0,1,2,...
                Each fold contains a list of the dictionaries for each image-sample in the fold. Each dict contains two keys: "image" and "label", each with a relative path
                from dataset_name. 

        Inputs:
            dataset_abs_path: The absolute path to the dataset directory
            exp_data_type: The data split type for the experiment (e.g. val, test)
            fold: Optional, in instances where the experiment is done on a validation fold.

        Returns: 
            Returns the list of dictionaries for the paths of the images and labels.
